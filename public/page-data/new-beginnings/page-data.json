I would agree. Without a budget\nwe have no idea how much money we have or how much money we’re spending.\nA budget is a plan for our money and we know that to fail to plan is\nto plan to fail.</p>\n<p>But a budget in itself does not change our habits. For those of us who are\neven slightly paying attention, our budget merely reveals the difference between\nthe habits we currently have and the habits we aspire to have. This difference\nis revealed progressively as we track our spending and record our spending in\nour budget. With this information each of us will follow a different path\nthat is not not guided by our budget, but by the relationship we have with money.</p>\n<p>Our relationship with money is like the relationship between an untamed horse\nand it’s master. Depending on our upbringing and instruction with money, we\neither have a high level of confidence as to our competence to tame the wild\nbeast of money, or we have a fear of money and avoid taming the beast. In either\ncase money is a beast, but whether we are confident and competent or fearful and\nignorant, we can\nall learn how to tame this beast. This relationship determines the path we take\nas we discover, through a budget, how tame this beast is. And let us not forget,\nwe have to live with this beast our entire lives.</p>\n<p>If</p>\n<h2>On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much</h2>\n<p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad\nCommas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text\ndidn’t listen.
