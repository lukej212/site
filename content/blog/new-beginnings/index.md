There are two things we need to have right relationship and money:

1. Understanding that our money isn't ours
2. A budget

When we start getting our finances in order, the first thing we usually
hear is that we need to make a budget. I would agree. Without a budget
we have no idea how much money we have or how much money we're spending.
A budget is a plan for our money and we know that to fail to plan is
to plan to fail.

But a budget in itself does not change our habits. For those of us who are
even slightly paying attention, our budget merely reveals the difference between
the habits we currently have and the habits we aspire to have. This difference
is revealed progressively as we track our spending and record our spending in
our budget. With this information each of us will follow a different path
that is not not guided by our budget, but by the relationship we have with money.

Our relationship with money is like the relationship between an untamed horse
and it's master. Depending on our upbringing and instruction with money, we
either have a high level of confidence as to our competence to tame the wild
beast of money, or we have a fear of money and avoid taming the beast. In either
case money is a beast, but whether we are confident and competent or fearful and
ignorant, we can
all learn how to tame this beast. This relationship determines the path we take
as we discover, through a budget, how tame this beast is. And let us not forget,
we have to live with this beast our entire lives.

rewritten, then they are still using her.
