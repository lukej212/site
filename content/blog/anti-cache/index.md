We live in a world of computers. I’m writing this on a computer and you’re reading this on one. I wrote the previous sentence in the past, but you read it as happening in the present. Computers need memory to function, and they wouldn’t be able to execute such incredible tasks without it. However, all memory is cached and can be out of date the moment it is stored. A cache is where data is stored in memory.

If you remember what I wrote in the previous paragraph, that memory is stored in a cache of sorts – the cache of your mind. Like all memory storage devices, that cache of your mind can be out of date. Nothing is for certain. What you believe to be true about the world could very well be false. A friend you knew to be in good health may now be sick. Your bank account might be compromised, and you have less money than you think. 

Not only can things that were once true now be false, but things that you believe to be true right now could be false. The last article you read online may have left out information or perhaps presented false information. The last research article you read could have fudged the numbers. The last book you finished could have misrepresented its sources or made logically fallacious claims. 

Even what you know for certain, without a shadow of a doubt, can easily be untrue. Our memories aren’t perfect. It’s well known that people consistently misremember events. What we once knew may have been corrupted by lack of sleep, hallucinations, or even a brain disease. 

The only trustworthy cache would not be a cache at all. It must always be up-to-date and an exact mirror of reality. This cache cannot exist in human minds because as I’ve just argued, our minds cannot be trusted. This cache is ultimate truth. This cache is the creator of all things – it is God. 

God is the being that makes all true knowledge possible. He has revealed himself through nature and holy scripture. God defines reality because He created it. We can trust what He tells us because He cannot lie. Our basis of all scientific knowledge does not rest on corruptible human minds but on predictable creation. Scientific laws were not constructed by man, they are products of creation discovered by man. 

Nature reveals truth, but that truth is coagulated by scripture. Unless we know scripture, all our knowledge is nothing because any conclusion we reach contrary to what is revealed in scripture is a jumbled mess without meaning. Our striving would be striving after chaos and we would be undone. The only reason secular civilization persists is because of the grace of God and its leaching from a Christian worldview. 

So, fill your mind with scripture, which is uncorruptible truth. It is the anti-cache because it is timeless in its application. It is the definition of reality because by it we know God. Day by day you will be made new, and you will resemble more and more the One who is truth, Jesus Christ.
