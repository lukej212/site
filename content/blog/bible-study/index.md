description: "The end of an era"

The era has come to an end. Our men’s bible study started at the end of 2018 and lasted through the beginning of 2021. It started with me and Duncan Roberts. Our studies included Hebrews, James, Acts, and an experiment with a systematic theology. We typically met at 6:30am at George’s Family Restaurant.

Some of my best memories are from showing up to George’s half-awake and ordering a cup of coffee while making small talk with a brother. I was happy knowing he made the effort to get up early enough to make it. It became custom to talk about life for about half the time and for the other half to walk through the scripture and the commentary we would use as a companion.

The group of men grew over time from only me and Duncan for the first year to include Turner Fehrenbach, Daniel Klockenga, Denver Langford, and Stephen Sanders. The bible study might not be over for good, but Duncan got a new job that requires him to work earlier in the day and since he helped found the group, the chapter has ended. Duncan would drive from Pleasant Hope to meet me in Springfield which is a 30-minute drive and that meant a lot to me especially in the beginning.

Although the bible study won’t look the same, will still strive for closer fellowship with our brothers despite the divergence of our lives. The culture today seems increasingly hostile towards the church. Sin crouches at the door. Therefore, married and single men need strong friendships through which to sharpen, admonish, and confide in each other. May this all be done in the Holy Spirit and with reverence toward God’s word.
