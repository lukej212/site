Before you read this you might be telling yourself, "I dress how I like. I do what
I want. It doesn't matter how I dress as long as I feel cozy. I express myself through
my gangster street style and casual look." While these all may be true, know that there are at
least three style sins that should you commit, not only should you feel ashamed, but you should
find new friends because if your friends don't care enough about you to warn you about these,
they don't deserve you as a friend. And if you commit these sins after your friends advise against it,
they should unfriend you and ostracize you in public. It's only for your good.

Clothes have a purpose, they're not merely meant to cover us, but they have an aesthetic function.

The three style sins are as follows:

1. Sweatpants in public
2. Jerseys
3. Thongs

#### Sweatpants in public

Sweatpants are a wonderful invention. They're confortable, they're warm, and they make you
look like an athlete. They can even be used as pajama pants in the colder months! But they
should never be worn in public, that is unless you're going to the gym or running around
your neighborhood like Rocky Balboa. Maybe you don't care about how you look, you don't
want people to think you're trying too hard. Think of it this way, sweatpants convey
ultimate pretentiosness. You think you've transcended conventions. But by wearing them you're telling people that you don't care who sees
you or how you look. If you're already thinking about what people are thinking, you obviously care!
I'm trying to point out the cognitive dissonance
that exists in your head - you're telling yourself it's a look instead of coming to terms
with the fact that you're just a lazy slob.

If you're argument is that they're just comfortable, you need to find better fitting jeans
or chinos. And if they're just too warm and cozy, buy a pair of long johns.

#### Jerseys

If you're a big Cheifs fan, that's fine. You like the Cubs? Cool! Leave your jersey
in the closest until you go watch the game. One of the traps many men fall into with sports
is that they vicariously live through collegiate and professional athletes. Wearing another
man's shirt with another man's name is emasculating. You're waving the white flag of surrender
saying that you're too fat and/or weak to ever be satisfied with your level of physicality. All
of the unathletic, unfit, average joes wearing number 15 should get off the couch and find
your sense of pride by going for a run or lifting some weights or maybe even joining a pickup game
of basketball.

If you're wearing the jersey because that athlete is your hero, you need to find better heros.

#### Thongs (flip flops)

Unless you're going to the beach or about to walk into the pool or hot tub, flip flops, thongs, slides, Birkenstocks - anything you put on your feet that doesn't cover your toes should not be worn in public. I'm not saying this becuase I have some aversion to feet. Feet aren't inherently ugly, but feet are generally gross and unflattering. If you can spare the public from seeing your feet, you should. On top of that, when you expose your toes you're asking for more dirt and grime to fester with your already unclean feet. Why was it such a humble act for Jesus to wash the disciples' feet? It's because feet are so disgusting. Showing off your feet is tantamount to not flushing after a healthy bowel movement and letting your roommate flush it for you. Please don't do it. Instead, cover them with a nice pair of sneakers or a pair of oxfords. Just never let anyone see your feet.
