#### Why I want to write

The best way I know to get better at running is to start running
and continue to run repetitively, every day. If you want to be a good runner,
you have to run as much as possible without negatively affecting
your health. What does this blog have to do with running? Nothing.
My point is that because I want to get better at writing, I need
to write more often and repetitively, but I will almost certainly
not write every day.

A friend recently told me how he's experienced ideas 'clicking' in
his mind as he's attempted to put them in his journal. Einstein once
said, "...if you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you don't understand
it yourself." Clarence Thomas once said, "...the genius is not to write a 5
cent idea in a ten dollar sentence. It's to put a ten dollar idea in a 5 cent sentence."
At times when I put into words what I think I know, I realize I don't
really know what I'm talking about. Writing more often, I hope, will
allow me to delineate between what I know and what I think I know. On top
of that, I want to be able to better elucidate what I do know.

#### Why I started a blog

Instead of only keeping a personal journal, I want to share my thoughts with
my friends and the public so I can get feedback and share what has been
on my mind with others. I want my friends to start writing too, and maybe
as they see my work, they'll be encouraged to start creating. So many of my
friends are engaged in learning about diverse and interesting ideas, I want them to
compose them in writing so the rest of us can examine their minds and learn
from them!

Also, because I work with software, this will be a way for me to learn
new software solutions. This is a very basic blogging template, but as
the content accumulates, I hope to build a better website to manage the
content.

#### What I'll be writing about

I'll be writing about what I find interesting and what I feel is important.
Since this blog is a challenge to myself, I'll also make posts that put me
outside my comfort zone e.g. comedy, poems, and narratives. I'll likely touch
on topics such as theology, economics, style, books, health and fitness, running,
etc.

<!-- This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
