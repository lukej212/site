You’re overthinking, <br>
Keep doing <br>
Change on the fly <br>

Fix what’s creaking<br>
Listen closely <br>
You’ll find it easy<br>

Where’s you’re meaning?<br>
Start there<br>
It has a source <br>
We all know it <br>

Truth<br>

He split the sea<br>
He feeds the birds<br>
He speaks through men<br>
He gave us His Word <br>

Take your thoughts<br>
Put them to works<br>
Obscure they may be<br>
It heals the hurt <br>

Test your feelings<br>
Then move on<br>
Let the chaff burn<br>
